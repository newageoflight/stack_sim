#+TITLE: Which stack should I use?
* Why should I care?
- It's probably fairer for everyone if we all use the same stack (as
  discussed [[file:readme.org][here]]).
* "Conventional" stack order
- Everyone knows this "conventional" stack which has been documented
  since at least 2016:
  1. RPA
  2. RNS
  3. POW
  4. StV
  5. Concord
  6. StG
  7. Westmead
  8. Hornsby
  9. JHH
  10. Liverpool
  11. Bankstown
  12. Gosford
  13. Wollongong
  14. Nepean
  15. Blacktown
- However based on the latest statistics, this might be *wrong*.
* "Statistical" stack order (based on 2019 data)
- Hospitals sorted in ascending order of allocations over first
  preferences ratio:
  1. RNS
  2. RPA
  3. Concord
  4. POW
  5. StV
  6. StG
  7. Hornsby
  8. Westmead
  9. Liverpool
  10. Gosford
  11. JHH
  12. Nepean
  13. Wollongong
  14. Blacktown
  15. Bankstown
- However, there are several reasons not to put this as your "stack":
  - The benefit of stacking is reliant on consensus. As far as I can
    tell the consensus is still to use the conventional stack.
  - Unless everyone agrees on a new stack order, there is no point
    trying to change it.
