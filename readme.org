* Introduction
- Disclaimer: there is NO guarantee that any of this is accurate. It
  is only based on hearsay about how the stack algorithm works
- Nonetheless, let's try to find out what the best strategy is for
  ordering your hospital preferences
* The algorithm
- The algorithm first looks at category
- Then allocates people of that category to each hospital by how
  they ranked their preferred hospitals
- It fills spots in each hospital by selecting from people who
  preferenced that hospital, in descending order of rank (e.g. 1st
  pref, then 2nd, etc.)
  - If there are more applicants who ranked that hospital (nth) than
    there are spots, it will randomly select just enough people from
    that group so all spots are filled
  - If the number of empty spaces is less than or equal to the
    number of spots, the hospital will take all of the applicants
    who ranked that hospital (nth)
- For nerds: pseudocode representation of the algorithm
#+BEGIN_SRC python
for category in categories:
  for hospital in hospitals:
    for rank in range(length(hospitals)):
      preferenced_this = filter(lambda a: a.preferences[rank] == hospital and a.category == category, unallocated_applicants)
      hospital.fill(min(preferenced_this, random.select(preferenced_this, hospital.capacity)))
#+END_SRC
* Implementation
- 3 possible scenarios were tested:
  1. Everybody preferences hospitals entirely randomly
  2. Everybody stacks
  3. Everybody stacks but moves a random hospital of their choice to
     first place
- Incomplete list of deviations from reality, simplifications and
  assumptions:
  1. No hospital is more favourable than another
  2. Everybody has the same stack (for simulation 2 and 3).
  3. Everyone who applies accepts the first job offer they get.
  4. There are no other entry schemes apart from the normal
     random-allocation route.
  5. Only 1 round of offers is simulated.
  6. Corollary from 4, 5: Category 1 applicants are basically guaranteed
     a job.
  7. Corollary from 6: Anyone below category 3 will not get a job.
- For nerds: the actual code of this simulation is on [[https://github.com/newageoflight/stack_sim/blob/master/stack_sim.py][Github]].
* Results
How to read the tables:
- nth :: Number of applicants that got their nth preference
- catn :: Category n applicants
- placed :: Applicants who matched into any hospital
- not_placed :: Applicants who did not match into any hospital
** Everyone is random

* Discussion
- In short, under each strategy:
  1. All random
     - Fairest gradation of ranks from top to bottom
     - Nobody actually selects like this IRL (unless you're a weirdo)
  2. All stack
     - It's basically communism for internships.
     - You have a near-equal chance at landing just about every
       hospital.
  3. All stack but put a random on top
     - Interestingly, you're most likely to get (in order) your first
       or 14th preference.
     - Proportionally, more people will be shafted to the bottom.
     - This appears to be most consistent with the strategy people use
       IRL.
- It is also consistent with the following observations:
  - "The last 4 are the most important" - sort of. In strategy 3, a
    proportionally larger number of people are being shafted
    to the bottom.
  - "Stacking hurts your chances of getting to preferences 1-6"
    (HETI, 2020) - true wherever stacking is used.
- If this is indeed HETI's algorithm, satisfaction appears to be
  maximised under strategy 1 or 3
- As previously mentioned, there are a lot of deviations between this
  simulation and the actual data produced by HETI.
  - Not only do I not have all the information to make this simulation
    completely accurate, I did not factor in for all the other entry
    pathways and schemes.
* What should you do?
- Depends on what you want
- There is not enough data to draw any definitive conclusions on what
  the "best" strategy is, especially since a lot of simplifications
  were made to run this model
  - Strategy 3 gives you the best chance of getting your first
    preference. IRL it may be best for Category 1 hospitals (RPA, RNS,
    POW, StV) given how popular they are.
  - Strategy 2 is best if you don't care where you will end up, but
    given that IRL it is mostly a mix between strategies 2 and 3, this
    might not lead to the same result.

  improve the simulation for future generations to use
* TODO Future directions/todos
- [ ] Significance analysis of results
- [ ] Further strategic analysis
- [ ] Fix the algorithm so it's more consistent with the real data
- [ ] Implement more scenarios e.g. some people stack, some people
  random
- [ ] More data is needed to make this more accurate e.g. how many
  people preference each hospital in what order every year?
